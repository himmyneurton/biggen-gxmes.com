        "Me and my friend learned HTML in a few hours and then decided to make a website together. We simply watched some youtube videos (which will be linked below) and we had enough knowlage to make a website. My friend and I hate having everyhting blocked on school chromebooks so that is what sparked the idea of a unblocked games site. I know that the website design isnt the best, but I am still working on learning CSS and website design. I overall really hope you guys enjoy the website. Have fun playing games!"
